# TinkerELEC Project

This is the Documentation of my Project to make the ASUS Tinker Board S (Rockchip RK3288) work better when running [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) and generally with newer Linux Kernels (>= 6.5).
The [Sourcecode](https://github.com/s7a7ic/TinkerELEC) is based on [LibreELEC.tv](https://github.com/LibreELEC/LibreELEC.tv), own patches and changes.
